<p id="title-2">Best Things To Eat In Mauritius</p>

<p id="text">For a tiny island of only 1.3 million people, Mauritius has an incredibly rich and diverse food culture, infused with influences from its mélange of inhabitants (Creole, French, Chinese and Indian people). The island is also blessed with fertile soil, so the local produce is incredible – from super-sized vegetables to sweet fruits.</p>

<p id="text1">Street food is fantastic in Mauritius – you can get everything from fresh coconut water, chopped fruit covered in chilli and sugar, hot curries topped with chilli and pickles wrapped in buttery breads, and Chinese fried noodles. Mauritius also has fabulous restaurants – from local eateries with authentic food to gourmet places that serve Mauritian fusion food.</p>
