<p id="title-2">Mauritian Culture</p>

<p id="text">Mauritian culture is based on the diversity of the population, that’s why there is no “official religion” in Mauritius. Hindus, Tamils, Muslims, Christians, Buddhists and others from all over the globe live in harmony and respect the free practice of all religions in Mauritius. The ancestral melting-pot that is Mauritian culture allows different faith communities to cohabit in mutual respect. Mauritius is an island of temples, churches and mosques.</p>

<p id="text1">The most prevalent religion in Mauritius is Hinduism, practiced by the Indian and Tamil communities in Mauritius. Around 20% of the Mauritian population is Muslim, this group is a model of tolerance and spirituality. Oneof the oldest mosques in Mauritius is Al-Aqsa,and it was built over a century and a half ago. Despite the small number of Christians on the island, there are more than 20 churches to visit and the prettiest is certainly the church at Cap Malheureux.</p>
